This project is a VBA application for managing pathology lab processes, including patient data management and bill generation. The application is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use for lab personnel, including pathologists and lab technicians.

## Features
**Patient Data Entry**: The application allows lab personnel to manage patient data, including test results and personal information.

**Billings**: The application allows lab personnel to quickly generate bills 

## About this project
This was a group project put together by me and my fellow college mates Pranjal Dhamane and Soham Vikhare. For this project, we needed insights on what processes take place in a pathology lab and what the part of their operations that we can use VBA to automate.

We went to Pathology named Vivanta Diagnostics in Malad, Mumbai to gather information and to see how we can put our knowledge in VBA to use for this particular project.

- We have attached the Excel Workbook.
- We have attached a design document explaining the structure and use of each control and worksheet.

This was a collaborative project made and maintained by Asif Sayyed, Pranjal Dhamane, and Soham Vikhare.
