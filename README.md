## About this project
This was a group project put together by me and my fellow college mates Pranjal Dhamane and Soham Vikhare. For this project we needed insights on what processes take place in a pathology lab and what are the part of their operations that we can use VBA to automate.

We went to Pathology named Vivanta Diagnotics in Malad, Mumbai to gather information and to see how we can put our knowledge in VBA to use for this particular project.

- We have attached the Excel Workbook.
- We have attached a design document explaining the structure and use of each control and worksheet.

This was a collaborative projecte made and maintained by Asif Sayyed, Pranjal Dhamane and Soham Vikhare.
